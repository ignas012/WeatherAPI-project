# WeatherAPI project

This Git repository houses a set of Python scripts designed to seamlessly integrate weather data retrieval from an API, perform data analysis, and generate comprehensive reports.

## Libraries

Before diving into the project, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed on your system:

**1. Matplotlib.** A versatile library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

**2. Pandas.** A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, providing data structures like dataframes.

**3. NumPy.** Fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, offering support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.

To install these libraries run the following command in the terminal `pip install -r requirements.txt`

It will install libraries from [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file

## Running the codes

`api_data_request` script is responsible for parsing data from the API and storing it in a CSV file.
  
`analysis.ipynb` script graphs the data from [2021 met킬 orai.csv](<2021 met킬 orai.csv>) and [2022 met킬 orai.csv](<2021 met킬 orai.csv>)
